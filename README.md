# dropwizard-auth-jwt

An implementation of the JSON Web Token (JWT) draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-20 for Dropwizard.

## What is it?
JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is digitally signed using JSON Web Signature (JWS).

Check out http://jwt.io/

## What is available in this forked version?
To be able to support WSO2, I have added custom header selection, in particular x-jwt-assertion.
Also I had to downgrade to Dropwizard 0.9.2 due to java.util.Optional and Guava's optional implementation. 
And I have changed the Jose library to com.nimbusds since WSO2 signature were not successfully validated by Jose4j. 

## What's new in the *upcoming* v1.0.0 release
* Replaced the JWT token generation and verification with [jose4j](https://bitbucket.org/b_c/jose4j/wiki/Home). 

## What's new in v0.9.2-0
* Updated the dependencies to Dropwizard 0.9.2.

## What's new in v0.9.1-1
* Added support for CachingAuthenticator.

## What's new in v0.9.1-0
* Added support for Dropwizard 0.9.x.
* Support for extracting JWT tokens from cookies.

## Getting Started

To use this library in your project you can download it from Maven Central.

For Dropwizard 0.9.1 use:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.toastshaman</groupId>
    <artifactId>dropwizard-auth-jwt</artifactId>
    <version>0.9.2-0</version>
</dependency>
```

For Dropwizard 0.8.1 use:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.toastshaman</groupId>
    <artifactId>dropwizard-auth-jwt</artifactId>
    <version>0.8.1-1</version>
</dependency>
```

## Example
See this [code example](https://github.com/ToastShaman/dropwizard-auth-jwt/tree/master/src/test/java/com/github/toastshaman/dropwizard/auth/jwt/example) 
if you want to use this code your dropwizard application. Once you have started the example application here are some 
sample requests to generate a valid and an expired token:

```
curl -X GET -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" 'http://localhost:8080/jwt/generate-valid-token'
```

or you can create an invalid token instead to see a failure case with: 

```
curl -X GET -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" 'http://localhost:8080/jwt/generate-expired-token'
```

Once you have a token, you can send it to the following endpoint to get some information about the logged in user:

```
curl -X GET \
-H "Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJpYXQiOjE0NDkzMTQwOTUsInN1YiI6Imdvb2QtZ3V5In0.oFXdelQECJrw6_e4gR1HU3ljFvY8zmf2EHDsBnnea7n2UDBipmNDbx3bw-Bzzq-FwtEO6qzageK2jbJxM6JHbQ" \
-H "Cache-Control: no-cache" 'http://localhost:8080/jwt/check-token'
```
